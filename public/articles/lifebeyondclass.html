                    The whole year has been a roller-coaster ride with so many
                    events of all genres with contributions from every single

                    our emotions towards college activities. For many of us,
                    it’s the first time away from home and there are many things
                    we miss. Festivals are sure to top the list; almost every
                    single month is marked by a festival that brings together
                    everyone. We celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi on a very grand
                    scale and that too for the first time in our campus. We had
                    pujas in our respective hostels, special dinners arranged
                    for the occasion and the most important Ganesh Visarjan also
